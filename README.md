# NetWorth-Calculator

Used basic HTML and JavaScript to create a web page to calculate an individual's net worth. 
The web page fields were an adaption of the Charles Schwab Co.'s net worth guide worksheet. 
This project was to primarily practice and enhance the understanding of using JavaScript 
with HTML to create a functional web page.
